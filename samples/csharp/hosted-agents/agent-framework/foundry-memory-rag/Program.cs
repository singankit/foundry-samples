// Foundry Memory RAG Agent
//
// Demonstrates how to host an agent that uses FoundryMemoryProvider so user-private memories
// persist across requests and across sessions. The agent plays a personal coach who remembers
// the user's training goals, dietary preferences, and constraints, and uses them in later turns.
//
// Memory store creation: EnsureMemoryStoreCreatedAsync runs once at startup and is idempotent.
// The store name and embedding model are environment-driven so azd provisioning can wire them.
