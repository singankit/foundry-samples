/*
 * Foundry Toolbox (Server-Side Tools) — Agent Framework Responses agent for C#
 *
 * Hosted agent that loads a Foundry Toolbox and passes its tools to the agent as
 * SERVER-SIDE tools. The Foundry platform handles tool discovery and invocation
 * through the Responses API — the agent process does not connect to the toolbox
 * MCP proxy or invoke tools locally.
 *
 * Required environment variables:
 *   FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT       — Foundry project endpoint (auto-injected in hosted containers)
 *   AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME — Model deployment name (declared in agent.manifest.yaml)
 *   TOOLBOX_NAME                   — Name of the Foundry Toolbox to load
